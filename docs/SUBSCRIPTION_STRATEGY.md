|--------|--------|
| Free to Paid Conversion | 5-10% |
| Monthly Churn Rate | <5% |
| Customer Satisfaction | >4.5 stars |
| Feature Usage (Premium) | >60% using premium features weekly |

---

## Summary

**The £2.99/month subscription is justified because:**

1. 💰 **It's affordable** - Less than a coffee, more than fair for the value
2. 🔒 **It funds privacy** - No ads, no data selling, no compromises
3. 📈 **It enables growth** - Continuous improvement and new features
4. 🏆 **It delivers value** - Features that genuinely help users
5. 🛡️ **It ensures longevity** - A sustainable app that won't disappear

**The competitor is free because they either:**
- Sell user data
- Show advertisements
- Have unsustainable funding
- Will eventually charge or shut down

**We charge because we respect our users enough to be honest about costs.**

## Technical Architecture Addendum

This addendum translates the premium strategy into an enforceable, scalable system design for CSU Tracker.

### 1) Product Architecture and Subscription Gating

#### Subscription tiers and entitlements
- Free: 30-day history limit, no charts, no cloud backup, no sharing
- Premium (GBP 2.99/month): unlimited history, advanced reports, cloud backup, sharing

#### Data model changes
- `subscriptions_plan`: `id`, `name`, `price_gbp`, `billing_period`, `entitlements_json`
- `subscriptions_subscription`: `user_id`, `plan_id`, `status`, `provider`, `provider_subscription_id`, `current_period_start`, `current_period_end`, `cancel_at_period_end`, `grace_period_end`, `trial_end`, `created_at`, `updated_at`
- `subscriptions_entitlement_override`: `user_id`, `entitlement_key`, `value`, `reason`, `expires_at`, `created_by`
- `tracking_user_profile`: `id`, `user_id`, `display_name`, `created_at`
- `reporting_export_job`: `id`, `user_id`, `format`, `from_date`, `to_date`, `status`, `file_url`, `expires_at`
- `reporting_report_schedule`: `id`, `user_id`, `frequency`, `timezone`, `format`, `last_sent_at`
- `backups_snapshot`: `id`, `user_id`, `status`, `storage_path`, `created_at`, `encryption_metadata`
- `sharing_contact_access`: `id`, `owner_user_id`, `contact_email`, `role`, `created_at`, `revoked_at`
- `audit_log`: `id`, `actor_id`, `action`, `target_type`, `target_id`, `metadata_json`, `created_at`

#### Subscription status handling
- Normalize provider states into: `trialing`, `active`, `past_due`, `grace`, `canceled`, `expired`
- Entitlements derive from status: `trialing` and `active` get premium, `past_due` gets a short `grace` window, `expired` reverts to free
- Keep an append-only audit log of status transitions and entitlement overrides

#### UI and API gating
- UI: call `/me/entitlements` and render gates based on server-issued entitlements, not local config
- API: enforce entitlements in middleware or per-endpoint decorators, never trust client hints

#### Edge cases
- Expiry mid-period: honor `current_period_end`, then move to `grace` if payment fails
- Downgrade: retain historical data, but restrict access to 30-day window until upgrade
- Grace period: configurable (for example 7 days), limited to essential services

### 2) Feature Flag and Entitlement System

#### Design goals
- Scalable: flags evaluated server-side and cached with short TTLs
- Auditable: centralized override table with reason and expiry
- Safe: server enforces entitlements; client only reads

#### Model
- `feature_flag`: global flags for rollout (not billing)
- `entitlement_key`: billing-derived permissions (for example `reports_advanced`, `history_unlimited`)
- `user_entitlement_override`: admin grants, trials, or goodwill credits with expiry

#### Evaluation flow (pseudocode)
```python
def resolve_entitlements(user):
    sub = subscription_service.get_current(user.id)
    entitlements = FREE_ENTITLEMENTS.copy()
    if sub and sub.status in {"trialing", "active", "grace"}:
        entitlements.update(PREMIUM_ENTITLEMENTS)
    entitlements = apply_overrides(entitlements, user.id)
    return entitlements

def require_entitlement(user, key):
    if not resolve_entitlements(user).get(key, False):
        raise PermissionError("premium_required")
```

#### Example API check
```python
@require_entitlement("reports_advanced")
def generate_report(request):
    ...
```

### 3) 30-Day History Limit vs Unlimited History

#### Query strategies
- Enforce on all read paths: if user lacks `history_unlimited`, add `occurred_at >= now - 30d`
- Use query builders or model managers to avoid missing filters

#### Indexing considerations
- Composite index on `(owner_user_id, occurred_at DESC)` for fast recent lookups
- Optional monthly partitioning for very large datasets

#### Upgrade and downgrade handling
- On upgrade: full history becomes visible immediately
- On downgrade: keep data; queries filter to last 30 days
- Optional background job to compact or archive older data if storage cost becomes an issue

### 4) Cloud Backup System (Premium Only)

#### Architecture
- Backup service runs as async jobs, triggered nightly for premium users
- Data stored in object storage with versioning and retention policies
- Encryption in transit via TLS; encryption at rest via per-user envelope keys

#### Zero-access by staff
- Encrypt user data with per-user data keys managed by KMS with strict IAM
- Keys are not exportable; only the application service account can decrypt during restore
- Audit all decrypt operations and expose a user-facing restore history

#### Restore flow
- User initiates manual restore in-app
- System validates entitlement, then restores to a new snapshot with rollback support

### 5) Advanced PDF Reporting Engine

#### Recommended approach
- Use HTML + CSS for layout, rendered by headless Chromium (Playwright/Puppeteer)
- Render charts as SVG via Chart.js or ECharts, embedded directly in the HTML
- Use a branded design system: cover page, section headers, typography, and consistent spacing

#### Rendering pipeline
1. Fetch report data and compute aggregates
2. Render charts to SVG/PNG
3. Fill HTML templates (Jinja/React) with data and chart assets
4. Render PDF with headless Chromium
5. Store in object storage and issue signed URLs

### 6) Multi-Format Export System

#### Architecture
- Use `reporting_export_job` and async workers
- Supported formats: PDF, CSV, Excel (XLSX)
- Validate requested date range against entitlements before enqueue

#### Example export guard
```python
def validate_date_range(user, start, end):
    if not has_entitlement(user, "history_unlimited"):
        if (end - start).days > 30:
            raise PermissionError("free_tier_limit")
```

### 7) Scheduled Reports

#### Scheduling and delivery
- Store preferences in `reporting_report_schedule` (frequency, timezone, format)
- Use a scheduler (Celery beat or cron) to enqueue jobs per user timezone
- Send emails with links to reports or secure attachments

#### Failure handling
- Retry with exponential backoff
- Mark schedule as failed after N attempts and notify user
- Dead-letter queue for permanent failures

#### Email templates
- Use MJML or HTML templates with strict branding
- Include unsubscribe and report-history links

### 8) Dashboard Visualisation Layer

#### UI composition
- Summary cards (sleep, mood, activity) with trend deltas
- Progress rings and sparklines for quick scanning
- Dedicated insights panel with explainable highlights

#### Performance and accessibility
- Aggregate on the server for large datasets
- Virtualize long lists and lazy-load chart modules
- Accessible color palette and text alternatives for charts

### 9) Comparison Reports Logic

#### Period definition
- Week: ISO week (Mon-Sun); Month: calendar month
- Compare equal-length periods; for partial current periods, compare same number of days

#### Pseudocode
```python
def comparison_range(start, end):
    length = (end - start).days + 1
    prev_end = start - timedelta(days=1)
    prev_start = prev_end - timedelta(days=length - 1)
    return (prev_start, prev_end)
```

#### Edge cases
- Missing data: show "no data" instead of zero-based percent changes
- Division by zero: display absolute change only

### 10) Insight Generation Engine

#### Explainable pipeline
1. Normalize events and compute daily aggregates
2. Generate candidate patterns (weekday vs weekend, morning vs evening, trend slopes)
3. Score with effect size and sample confidence
4. Emit insights only if confidence exceeds threshold

#### Scoring logic (example)
```python
def score_insight(delta, stdev, samples):
    if samples < 14:
        return 0
    effect = abs(delta) / max(stdev, 0.1)
    return min(1.0, effect * (samples / 30.0))
```

### 11) Insight Safety and Trust

#### Guardrails
- No medical claims or diagnoses
- No judgmental language; focus on observations
- Suppress insights on small sample sizes or high variance

#### Template examples
- "On weekdays, average sleep is 20% higher than weekends (based on 6 weeks)."
- "This is a trend, not a diagnosis. Consider discussing changes with a professional if needed."

### 12) Priority Notification System

#### Prioritization model
- Base priority by category (safety > health > routine)
- User feedback adjusts category weights
- Emergency overrides bypass quiet hours for critical events

#### Feedback loop
- Thumbs-up/down on notifications updates per-user weight table
- Auto-suppress repeated low-value notifications

### 13) Smart Reminders

#### Adaptive scheduling
- Learn likely times from recent user actions
- Use decay to adapt as routines change
- Provide user control for minimum and maximum reminder frequency

### 14) User Profile Architecture

#### Data model
- `user_profile` belongs to a single user account
- Queries scoped by `user_id`
- Index on `user_id` for fast lookup

#### Reporting
- Aggregate per user with precomputed summaries for dashboards

### 15) Sharing and Permissions

#### Model
- `sharing_contact_access` with roles: `view`, `edit`, `admin`
- Per-report or per-export permissions, not global
- Invite flow with expiring tokens and audit logs

#### Revocation handling
- Immediate access removal and token invalidation
- Log all access changes in `audit_log`

### 16) Theming System

#### Design tokens
- Define CSS variables and mobile tokens for color, spacing, and typography
- Store user theme choice in profile preferences
- Cache computed themes to avoid runtime recalculation

### 17) Achievement and Gamification System

#### Principles
- Reward consistency without pressure
- Optional and easy to disable
- Avoid time-critical or competitive messaging

#### Implementation
- `achievement_definition` and `achievement_award` tables
- Server-side rules with caps to prevent over-optimization

### 18) Privacy-First Architecture Review

#### Data handling
- No ad tracking, no third-party data selling
- Minimize analytics to core product usage only
- Data retention and deletion policies aligned with GDPR

#### Compliance controls
- Right-to-export and right-to-delete endpoints
- Data processing agreements for all vendors
- Encryption, access logging, and least-privilege access

### 19) Subscription Analytics

#### Core metrics
- Conversion rate, churn, activation, premium feature usage
- Track in aggregated form with privacy-preserving event IDs

#### Privacy alignment
- No cross-app tracking identifiers
- Limit retention of raw events and aggregate daily

### 20) Phase-Based Implementation Plan

#### Phase 1 MVP (Launch Essentials)
- Subscription service + entitlements
- 30-day history enforcement and unlimited history for premium
- User profile preferences and cloud backups
- PDF reports (branded, charted)

#### Phase 2 Differentiation
- Scheduled reports and comparison logic
- AI insight engine with safety guardrails
- Dashboard visuals and export system expansion

#### Phase 3 Delight and Growth
- Report sharing with trusted contacts
- Smart notifications and reminders
- Achievements and theming expansion

#### Dependencies and risks
- Billing provider integration is a critical path
- Report rendering performance and chart fidelity
- Privacy compliance requires early legal review
